# Edge-Cluster-Detection
Scripts for automatically and reproducibly identifying which clusters, detected within an APT dataset, are on the edge of the dataset.

The latest version of R (https://cran.r-project.org/) and R-Studio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/?utm_source=downloadrstudio&utm_medium=Site&utm_campaign=home-hero-cta) should be installed.

To identify edge clusters you will need:
1) .pos file of dataset prior to cluster search
2) .indexed.pos file of clusters detected by cluster search
3) .csv of cluster stats (generated by IVAS after cluster searches performed)
